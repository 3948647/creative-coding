I was inspired by both fractal and glitch artists while developing this work. I found Desmond Paul Henry's fractal work which was interesting with his use of shapes and colour to create his artworks. As well as Mathieu St-Pierre glitch art which also showcases colours that are bright and eyecatching. In my piece I wanted to use colour as the story teller agaisnt black as I found it popped more. Using elements of both fractal and glitch art I used lines to de drwan overlapping, moving and going in different directions to create a chaotic art work. I went into leaning more towards fractal but when I started using p5 I was going more towards glitch.

Recursion in Desmond's work is what inspired me to have the lines moving in different directions and then the flashing was more from Mathieu's work. Combining the two ideas was an a way to create a hybrid of the two different types of art in a creative way. One more math based and other error based. I used the random function to generate random colours and the starting and end points of the lines again making it chaotic.
