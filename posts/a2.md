I was inspired by both fractal and glitch artists while developing this work. I found Desmond Paul Henry's fractal work which was interesting with his use of shapes and colour to create his artworks. As well as Mathieu St-Pierre glitch art which also showcases colours that are bright and eyecatching. In my piece I wanted to use colour as the story teller agaisnt black as I found it popped more. Using elements of both fractal and glitch art I used lines to de drwan overlapping, moving and going in different directions to create a chaotic art work. I went into leaning more towards fractal but when I started using p5 I was going more towards glitch.

Recursion in Desmond's work is what inspired me to have the lines moving in different directions and then the flashing was more from Mathieu's work. Combining the two ideas was an a way to create a hybrid of the two different types of art in a creative way. One more math based and other error based. I used the random function to generate random colours and the starting and end points of the lines again making it chaotic. 

Fractal art, inspired by mathematical concepts, often showcases intricate shapes and patterns that exhibit self-similar properties at various scales. Artists like Desmond Paul Henry have delved into fractal geometry to craft visually captivating artworks. In Henry's creations, the repetition of shapes and colours creates mesmerising patterns that draw me into a world of infinite detail. His adept use of colour to accentuate the complexity of fractal structures is particularly striking. 

Conversely, glitch art celebrates errors and distortions, transforming digital media into surreal and captivating visuals. Artists like Mathieu St-Pierre utilise digital manipulation techniques to introduce glitches, artefacts, and unexpected anomalies. St-Pierre's vibrant glitch artworks are a feast for the eyes, with their bold colours and dynamic compositions. Through the manipulation of digital media, glitch artists challenge conventional notions of perfection, embracing imperfections as part of the creative process.

In my artwork, I draw inspiration from both fractal and glitch art traditions. The use of lines to deconstruct, overlap, and move in different directions mirrors the self-similar patterns found in fractal geometry. Meanwhile, the flashing effect, inspired by glitch art, adds an element of unpredictability and dynamism to the composition. By combining elements of both fractal and glitch art, I aim to create a hybrid artwork that is both mathematically intriguing and visually captivating.

My decision to use colour as the primary storyteller against a black background, reminiscent of St-Pierre's vibrant glitch art, highlights the contrast between order and chaos in my composition. The incorporation of recursion, inspired by Henry's fractal art, adds depth and complexity to the piece, inviting viewers to explore its intricacies further.

Overall, my artwork serves as a testament to the diverse and dynamic nature of contemporary digital art. By blending mathematical precision with creative experimentation, I aim to produce a work that is uniquely my ownâ€”a synthesis of fractal and glitch art that pushes the boundaries of visual expression.
